# Submission Manager
**https://www.submissionmanager.net**

**Submission Manager** is an online system for accepting and managing written submissions for magazines and presses. It’s easy to use and flexible enough to work with any submission and reading process. **Submission Manager** allows you to:

* accept or reject submissions individually or en masse through your web site
* easily manage the genres that you accept
* control the number of submissions an author can make to your publication
* manage reading periods
* track submissions automatically
* customize the front end and back end appearance: all colors and fonts can be changed to work with your web design and your logo can appear on all pages

**Staff** have the ability to:

* search submissions and contacts in a variety of ways
* instantly view all submissions by a given writer
* assign submissions to editors and readers
* view all submissions using their web browser
* create standard and personalized email rejections

**Top-level editors** have the same privileges as staff, and can also:

* control who on their staff can accept/reject submissions
* sort and assign submissions by genre
* see which staff members have which submissions

This user-friendly system allows **submitters** to log their own address information into the database and log into their account to see the status of their submission. Upon submitting, all submitters receive automatic emails confirming that a submission has been received.

* Web Server
* PHP (version 5.5 or higher)
